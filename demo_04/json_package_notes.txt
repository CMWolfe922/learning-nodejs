==============================
CREATING A NPM NODE PACKAGE
==============================

Anytime we want to create a module we will have packages that
we rely on. Just like installing lodash and nodemon. So if I
want to create a npm package to be distributed. I need to create
a package.json file so that I can share with other developers
which packages they will need to run my module.

This works better than just uploading your module a long with all
the package files with it. Because sometimes, those package directories
can contain hundreds if not thousands of files and that is way too many to
transfer over.

so in the package.json we create a list of packages that we
want to install.

> How to create the package.json file?
--> Go to the command line and type: `npm init`

> Next you will get a bunch of questions to answer.
--> you can leave these as default if you like

> But answering the questions is how you determine the name of the
package, the author, the version, etc.. and it even finds all the packages
that are in our node_modules folder and lists them as dependencies for us.
